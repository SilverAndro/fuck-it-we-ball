# Fuck It We Ball (fiwb)

This mod uses a collection of hacks and tomfoolery to restore compatibility with other mods on quilt. This mostly involves modifying or removing mixins from other mods and replacing it with compatible code.

**You must be running minecraft in a JDK for this mod to work, the JRE does not support the attach API.**

## Compatibility fixes:
- Decorative blocks
- Combat Enchantments
- Big Beacons

## Internal toolkit
- Injection overwriting
- Mixin control (shouldApplyMixin for other mods)
- Mixin method removal
